Data storage is critical for all businesses. A good data storage does not allow any form of
anomalies and stores only relevant information in an ordered manner. If a data storage has
anomalies, it is affecting the efficiency and data integrity. For example, delete anomaly arise
upon the deletion of a row which also forces other useful data to be lost. In this project, you need
to design data record files to build this software system. Include the necessary artifacts related to
data storage in the project. You donâ€™t need to design a database for the project. Plain text files are
enough to achieve the goals for this project.
